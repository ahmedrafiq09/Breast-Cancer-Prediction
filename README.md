# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), for the early detection of breast cancer. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, we aim to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on morphological characteristics derived from fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses.

### Key Features
#### SVM Model: 
The project employs the powerful Support Vector Machines algorithm for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.
#### Data Visualization: 
A comprehensive exploration of the dataset is conducted through various visualizations, including pairplots, scatter plots, violin plots, box plots, and swarm plots, to unravel intricate patterns and relationships.
### Project Structure
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Uncover insights into the dataset's structure, features, and the distribution of malignant and benign cases.
#### Data Preprocessing: 
Prepare the dataset for model training by splitting it into training and testing sets.
#### Model Training and Evaluation: 
Utilize SVM to train a predictive model and evaluate its performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#### Individual Prediction: 
Showcase how the trained SVM model can make individual predictions for personalized breast cancer risk assessments.
### Contributions Welcome
Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged. If you have ideas for improving the model, exploring alternative algorithms, or enhancing the visualization techniques, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
