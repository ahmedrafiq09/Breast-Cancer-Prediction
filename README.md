# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), for the early detection of breast cancer. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, we aim to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on morphological characteristics derived from fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses.

### Key Features
#### SVM Model: The project employs the powerful Support Vector Machines algorithm for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.
#### Data Visualization: A comprehensive exploration of the dataset is conducted through various visualizations, including pairplots, scatter plots, violin plots, box plots, and swarm plots, to unravel intricate patterns and relationships.

### Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged. If you have ideas for improving the model, exploring alternative algorithms, or enhancing the visualization techniques, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
